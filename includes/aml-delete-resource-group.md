If you don't plan to use the resources you created here, delete them so you don't incur any charges.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left.
 
   ![Delete in Azure portal](./media/aml-delete-resource-group/delete-resources.png)

1. From the list, select the resource group you created.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter the resource group name, and then select **Delete**.

   If you see the error message "Cannot delete resource before nested resources are deleted," you must delete any nested resources first. For information on how to delete nested resources, see [this troubleshooting section](../articles/machine-learning/desktop-workbench/known-issues-and-troubleshooting-guide.md#cant-delete-experimentation-account).
