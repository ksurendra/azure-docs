# Virtual machine offer

This section outlines the elements of publishing a Virtual Machine (VM), and is intended as a guide for the publisher to the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com).  From this viewpoint, it is divided into the following main parts:

- [Prerequisites](./cpp-prerequisites.md) - lists the technical and business requirements before creating or publishing a VM offer
- [Create VM offer](./cpp-create-offer.md) - lists the steps required to create a new VM offer entry using the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com)
- [Create VM technical assets](./cpp-create-technical-assets.md) - how to create the technical assets for a VM solution and how to configure this package as a VM offer on the Azure Marketplace
- [Publish VM offer](./cpp-publish-offer.md) - how to submit the offer for publishing to the Azure Marketplace


## VM Publishing process flow

The following diagram illustrates the high-level steps in publishing a VM offer.

1. Create the offer - All the details and information about the offer is configured, including the offer description, marketing materials, legal, support information and asset specifications.

2. Create the business and technical assets - Create the business assets (legal documents and marketing materials) and technical assets for the associated solution (here, the VMs and attached disks). 

3. Create the SKU - Create the associated SKU(s) associated with the offering and submit them.  A unique SKU is required for each image you are planning to publish. 
 
4. Certify and publish the offer -  Once the offer and the technical assets are completed, you can submit the offer. This submission will start the publishing process, in which the solution is tested, validated, certified, then "goes live" on the marketplace.  

## Next steps

Before you consider these steps, you must meet the [technical and business requirements](./cpp-prerequisites.md) for publishing a VM to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.
