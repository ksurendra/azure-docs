# How to use Azure Digital Twins Swagger

Each provisioned Azure Digital Twins instance includes its own automatically generated Swagger reference documentation.

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) (or [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)) unites complex API information into an interactive and language-agnostic reference resource. Specifically, Swagger provides critical reference material about which JSON payloads, HTTP methods, and specific endpoints to use to perform operations against an API.

## Swagger summary

Swagger provides an interactive summary of your API including:

* API and Object Model information.
* REST API endpoints specifying required request payloads, headers, parameters, context paths, and HTTP methods.
* Testing of API functionalities.
* Example response information for validating and confirming HTTP responses.
* Error code information.

Swagger is therefore a convenient tool to assist with development and testing calls made to the Management API.

> [!TIP]
> For reference, a Swagger sneak preview is provided to demonstrate the API feature set.
> It's hosted at [docs.westcentralus.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger](https://docs.westcentralus.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger).

You can access your own, generated, Management API Swagger documentation at:

```plaintext
https://yourInstanceName.yourLocation.azuresmartspaces.net/management/swagger
```

| Custom Attribute Name | Replace With |
| --- | --- |
| *yourInstanceName* | The name of your Azure Digital Twins instance |
| *yourLocation* | Which server region your instance is hosted on |

## Reference material

Automatically generated reference material explains critical concepts and Object Models.

A concise summary describes the API:

![Swagger top][1]

Core API Object Models are also listed:

![Swagger models][2]

You can click into each listed Object Model for a more detailed summary of key attributes:

![Swagger model][3]

The generated Swagger Object Models are convenient to see all available Azure Digital Twins [Objects and APIs](./concepts-objectmodel-spatialgraph.md). It's a great resource for developers to use when building solutions on Azure Digital Twins.

## Endpoint summary

Swagger also provides a thorough overview of all endpoints that compose the API.

Each listed endpoint also includes the required request information such as:

* Required parameters.
* Required parameter data types.
* The HTTP method to access the resource.

![Swagger endpoints][4]

Each resource can be clicked to see a more detailed overview.

## Using Swagger to test endpoints

One of the powerful functionalities Swagger provides is the ability to **Try it out** or test an API endpoint directly through the documentation UI.

After clicking into a specific endpoint, you'll see a  **Try it out** button:

![Swagger try][5]

Expanding that section brings up input fields for each required and optional parameter. Enter the values accordingly and click **Execute**:

![Swagger tried][6]

After executing the test, you can validate the response data.

## Swagger response data

Each listed endpoint also includes response body data to validate your development and tests. These examples include the desired status codes and JSON for successful HTTP requests.

![Swagger response][7]

The examples also include error codes to help debug or improve failing tests.

## Swagger OAuth 2.0 authorization

To interactively test requests against API resources protected by OAuth 2.0, see the [official documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/).
