# Send events to Azure Event Hubs using the .NET Framework
Azure Event Hubs is a Big Data streaming platform and event ingestion service, capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. Event Hubs can process and store events, data, or telemetry produced by distributed software and devices. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters. For detailed overview of Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) and [Event Hubs features](event-hubs-features.md).

This tutorial shows how to send events to an event hub using a console application written in C# using the .NET Framework. 

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need the following prerequisites:

* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or higher](http://visualstudio.com).

## Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub
The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md), then proceed with the following steps in this tutorial.

## Create a console application

In Visual Studio, create a new Visual C# Desktop App project using the **Console Application** project template. Name the project **Sender**.

## Add the Event Hubs NuGet package

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Sender** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**. 
2. Click the **Browse** tab, then search for `WindowsAzure.ServiceBus`. Click **Install**, and accept the terms of use.

    Visual Studio downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure Service Bus library NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.ServiceBus).

## Write code to send messages to the event hub

1. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
    ```csharp
    using System.Threading;
    using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;
    ```
2. Add the following fields to the **Program** class, substituting the placeholder values with the name of the event hub you created in the previous section, and the namespace-level connection string you saved previously.
   
    ```csharp
    static string eventHubName = "Your Event Hub name";
    static string connectionString = "namespace connection string";
    ```
3. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
      ```csharp
      static void SendingRandomMessages()
      {
          var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, eventHubName);
          while (true)
          {
              try
              {
                  var message = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
                  Console.WriteLine("{0} > Sending message: {1}", DateTime.Now, message);
                  eventHubClient.Send(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message)));
              }
              catch (Exception exception)
              {
                  Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
                  Console.WriteLine("{0} > Exception: {1}", DateTime.Now, exception.Message);
                  Console.ResetColor();
              }
       
              Thread.Sleep(200);
          }
      }
      ```
   
      This method continuously sends events to your event hub with a 200-ms delay.
4. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
      ```csharp
      Console.WriteLine("Press Ctrl-C to stop the sender process");
      Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to start now");
      Console.ReadLine();
      SendingRandomMessages();
      ```
5. Run the program, and ensure that there are no errors.
  
Congratulations! You have now sent messages to an event hub.
