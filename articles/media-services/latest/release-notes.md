# Azure Media Services v3 release notes 

To stay up-to-date with the most recent developments, this article provides you with information about:

* The latest releases
* Known issues
* Bug fixes
* Deprecated functionality
* Plans for changes

## October 2018 - GA

This section describes Azure Media Services (AMS) October updates.

### REST v3 GA release

The [REST v3 GA release](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media/stable/2018-07-01) includes more APIs for Live, Account/Asset level manifest filters, and DRM support.

#### Azure Resource Management 

Support for Azure Resource Management enables unified management and operations API (now everything in one place).

Starting with this release, you can use Resource Manager templates to create Live Events.

#### Improvement of Asset operations 

The following improvements were introduced:

- Ingest from HTTP(s) URLs or Azure Blob Storage SAS URLs.
- Specify you own container names for Assets. 
- Easier output support to create custom workflows with Azure Functions.

#### New Transform object

The new **Transform** object simplifies the Encoding model. The new object makes it easy to create and share encoding Resource Manager templates and presets. 

#### Azure Active Directory authentication and RBAC

Azure AD Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enable secure Transforms, LiveEvents, Content Key Policies, or Assets by Role or Users in Azure AD.

#### Client SDKs  

Languages supported in Media Services v3: .NET Core, Java, Node.js, Ruby, Typescript, Python, Go.

#### Live encoding updates

The following live encoding updates are introduced:

- New low latency mode for live (10 seconds end-to-end).
- Improved RTMP support (increased stability and more source encoder support).
- RTMPS secure ingest.

    When you create a LiveEvent, you now get 4 ingest URLs. The 4 ingest URLs are almost identical, have the same streaming token (AppId), only the port number part is different. Two of the URLs are primary and backup for RTMPS. 
- 24-hour transcoding support. 
- Improved ad-signaling support in RTMP via SCTE35.

#### Improved Event Grid support

You can see the following Event Grid support improvements:

- Azure EventGrid integration for easier development with Logic Apps and Azure Functions. 
- Subscribe for events on Encoding, Live Channels, and more.

### CMAF support

CMAF and 'cbcs' encryption support for Apple HLS (iOS 11+) and MPEG-DASH players that support CMAF.

### Video Indexer

Video Indexer GA release was announced in August. For new information about currently supported features, see [What is Video Indexer](../../cognitive-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-overview.md?toc=/azure/media-services/video-indexer/toc.json&bc=/azure/media-services/video-indexer/breadcrumb/toc.json). 

### Plans for changes

#### Azure CLI 2.0
 
The Azure CLI 2.0 module that includes operations on all features (including Live, Content Key Policies, Account/Asset Filters, Streaming Policies) is coming soon. 

### Known issues

Only customers that used the preview API for Asset or AccountFilters are impacted by the following issue.

If you created Assets or Account Filters between 09/28 and 10/12 with Media Services v3 CLI or APIs, you need to remove all Asset and AccountFilters and re-create them due to a version conflict. 

## May 2018 - Preview

### .Net SDK

The following features are present in the .Net SDK:

* **Transforms** and **Jobs** to encode or analyze media content. For examples, see [Stream files](stream-files-tutorial-with-api.md) and [Analyze](analyze-videos-tutorial-with-api.md).
* **StreamingLocators** for publishing and streaming content to end-user devices
* **StreamingPolicies** and **ContentKeyPolicies** to configure key delivery and content protection (DRM) when delivering content.
* **LiveEvents** and **LiveOutputs** to configure the ingest and archiving of live streaming content.
* **Assets** to store and publish media content in Azure Storage. 
* **StreamingEndpoints** to configure and scale dynamic packaging, encryption, and streaming for both live and on-demand media content.

### Known issues

* When submitting a job, you can specify to ingest your source video using HTTPS URLs, SAS URLs, or paths to files located in Azure Blob storage. Currently, AMS v3 does not support chunked transfer encoding over HTTPS URLs.
