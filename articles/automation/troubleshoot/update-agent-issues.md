# Understand the agent check results in Update Management

There may be many reasons your Non-Azure machine is not showing **Ready** in Update Management. In Update Management, you can check the health of a Hybrid Worker agent to determine the underlying problem. This article discusses how to run the troubleshooter from the Azure portal and in offline scenarios.

## Start the troubleshooter

By clicking the **Troubleshoot** link under the **Update Agent Readiness** column in the portal, you launch the **Troubleshoot Update Agent** page. This page shows you problems with the agent and a link to this article to assist you in troubleshooting your issues.

> [!NOTE]
> The checks require the VM to be running. If the VM is not running you are presented with a button to **Start the VM**.

On the **Troubleshoot Update Agent** page, click **Run Checks**, to start the troubleshooter. The troubleshooter uses [Run command](../../virtual-machines/windows/run-command.md) to run a script on the machine to verify the dependencies that the agent has. When the troubleshooter is complete, it returns the result of the checks.

When complete, the results are returned in the window. The [check sections](#pre-requisistes-checks) provide information on what each check is looking for.

## Prerequisite checks

### Operating system

The OS check, verifies if the Hybrid Runbook Worker is running one of the following Operating Systems:

|Operating system  |Notes  |
|---------|---------|
|Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2 RTM    | Supports only update assessments.         |
|Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and later     |.NET Framework 4.5.1 or later is required. ([Download .NET Framework](/dotnet/framework/install/guide-for-developers))<br/> Windows PowerShell 4.0 or later is required. ([Download WMF 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40855))<br/> Windows PowerShell 5.1 is recommended for increased reliability.  ([Download WMF 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616))        |
|CentOS 6 (x86/x64) and 7 (x64)      | Linux agents must have access to an update repository. Classification-based patching requires 'yum' to return security data which CentOS does not have out of the box.         |
|Red Hat Enterprise 6 (x86/x64) and 7 (x64)     | Linux agents must have access to an update repository.        |
|SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86/x64) and 12 (x64)     | Linux agents must have access to an update repository.        |
|Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, and 18.04 LTS (x86/x64)      |Linux agents must have access to an update repository.         |

### .NET 4.5.1

The .NET framework check, verifies if the system has a minimum of [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653) present.

### WMF 5.1

The WMF check, verifies if the system has the required version of the Windows Management Framework. [Windows Management Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40855) is the lowest version supported. It is recommended that you install [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616) for increased reliability of the Hybrid Runbook Worker.

### TLS 1.2

This check, determines if you're using TLS 1.2 to encrypt your communications. TLS 1.0 is no longer supported by the platform and it's recommended that clients use TLS 1.2 to communicate with Update Management.

## Connectivity checks

### Registration endpoint

This check determines if the agent can properly communicate with the agent service.

Proxy and firewall configurations must allow the Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to communicate with the registration endpoint. For a list of addresses and ports to open, see [Network planning for Hybrid Workers](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning)

### Operations endpoint

This check determines if the agent can properly communicate with the Job Runtime Data Service.

Proxy and firewall configurations must allow the Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to communicate with the Job Runtime Data Service. For a list of addresses and ports to open, see [Network planning for Hybrid Workers](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning)

## VM service health checks

### Monitoring agent service status

This check determines if the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, `HealthService` is running on the machine.

To learn more about troubleshooting the service, see [The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is not running](hybrid-runbook-worker.md#mma-not-running).

To reinstall the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, see [Install and configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent](/log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid.md#install-and-configure-agent)

### Monitoring agent service events

This check determines if there have been any `4502` events in the Operations Manager log on the machine in the last 24 hours.

To learn more about this event, see the [troubleshooting guide](hybrid-runbook-worker.md#event-4502) for this event.

## Access permissions checks

### MachineKeys folder access

The Crypto Folder Access check determines if Local System Account has access to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA`

## Troubleshoot offline

You can use the troubleshooter offline on a Hybrid Runbook Worker by running the script locally. The script,  [Troubleshoot-WindowsUpdateAgentRegistration](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Troubleshoot-WindowsUpdateAgentRegistration) can be found on the PowerShell Gallery. An example of the output of this script is shown in the following example:
