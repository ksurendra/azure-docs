# Troubleshoot errors with runbooks

## Authentication errors when working with Azure Automation runbooks

### <a name="sign-in-failed"></a>Scenario: Sign in to Azure Account failed

#### Issue

You receive the following error when working with the `Add-AzureAccount` or `Connect-AzureRmAccount` cmdlets.
:

```
Unknown_user_type: Unknown User Type
```

#### Cause

This error occurs if the credential asset name isn't valid or if the username and password that you used to set up the Automation credential asset aren't valid.

#### Resolution

To determine what's wrong, take the following steps:  

1. Make sure that you don’t have any special characters, including the **@** character in the Automation credential asset name that you're using to connect to Azure.  
2. Check that you can use the username and password that are stored in the Azure Automation credential in your local PowerShell ISE editor. You can do check the username and password are correct by running the following cmdlets in the PowerShell ISE:  

   ```powershell
   $Cred = Get-Credential  
   #Using Azure Service Management
   Add-AzureAccount –Credential $Cred  
   #Using Azure Resource Manager  
   Connect-AzureRmAccount –Credential $Cred
   ```

3. If your authentication fails locally, it means that you haven’t set up your Azure Active Directory credentials properly. Refer to [Authenticating to Azure using Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-automation-authenticating-to-azure-using-azure-active-directory/) blog post to get the Azure Active Directory account set up correctly.  

4. If it looks like a transient error, try adding retry logic to your authentication routine to make authenticating more robust.

   ```powershell
   # Get the connection "AzureRunAsConnection"
   $connectionName = "AzureRunAsConnection"
   $servicePrincipalConnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name $connectionName

   $logonAttempt = 0
   $logonResult = $False

   while(!($connectionResult) -And ($logonAttempt -le 10))
   {
   $LogonAttempt++
   # Logging in to Azure...
   $connectionResult = Connect-AzureRmAccount `
      -ServicePrincipal `
      -TenantId $servicePrincipalConnection.TenantId `
      -ApplicationId $servicePrincipalConnection.ApplicationId `
      -CertificateThumbprint $servicePrincipalConnection.CertificateThumbprint

   Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
   }
   ```

### <a name="unable-to-find-subscription"></a>Scenario: Unable to find the Azure subscription

#### Issue

You receive the following error when working with the `Select-AzureSubscription` or `Select-AzureRmSubscription` cmdlets:

```
The subscription named <subscription name> cannot be found.
```

#### Error

This error occurs if the subscription name isn't valid or if the Azure Active Directory user who is trying to get the subscription details isn't configured as an admin of the subscription.

#### Resolution

To determine if you've properly authenticated to Azure and have access to the subscription you're trying to select, take the following steps:  

1. Test your script outside of Azure Automation to make sure it works stand-alone.
2. Make sure that you run the **Add-AzureAccount** cmdlet before running the **Select-AzureSubscription** cmdlet.  
3. If you still see this error message, modify your code by adding the **-AzureRmContext** parameter following the **Add-AzureAccount** cmdlet and then execute the code.

   ```powershell
   $Conn = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection
   Connect-AzureRmAccount -ServicePrincipal -Tenant $Conn.TenantID `
-ApplicationID $Conn.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $Conn.CertificateThumbprint

   $context = Get-AzureRmContext

   Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -AzureRmContext $context
    ```

### <a name="auth-failed-mfa"></a>Scenario: Authentication to Azure failed because multi-factor authentication is enabled

#### Issue

You receive the following error when authenticating to Azure with your Azure username and password:

```
Add-AzureAccount: AADSTS50079: Strong authentication enrollment (proof-up) is required
```

#### Cause

If you have multi-factor authentication on your Azure account, you can't use an Azure Active Directory user to authenticate to Azure. Instead, you need to use a certificate or a service principal to authenticate to Azure.

#### Resolution

To use a certificate with the Azure classic deployment model cmdlets, refer to [creating and adding a certificate to manage Azure services.](http://blogs.technet.com/b/orchestrator/archive/2014/04/11/managing-azure-services-with-the-microsoft-azure-automation-preview-service.aspx) To use a service principal with Azure Resource Manager cmdlets, refer to [creating service principal using Azure portal](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md) and [authenticating a service principal with Azure Resource Manager.](../../active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md)

## Common errors when working with runbooks

### <a name="task-was-cancelled"></a>Scenario: The runbook fails with the error: A task was canceled

#### Issue

Your runbook fails with an error similar to the following example:

```
Exception: A task was canceled.
```

#### Cause

This error can be caused by using outdated Azure modules.

#### Resolution

This error can be resolved by updating your Azure modules to the latest version.

In your Automation Account, click **Modules**, and click **Update Azure modules**. The update takes roughly 15 minutes, once complete re-run the runbook that was failing. To learn more about updating your modules, see [Update Azure modules in Azure Automation](../automation-update-azure-modules.md).

### <a name="child-runbook-auth-failure"></a>Scenario: Child runbook fails when dealing with multiple subscriptions

#### Issue

When executing child runbooks with `Start-AzureRmRunbook`, the child runbook fails to manage Azure resources.

#### Cause

The child runbook is not using the correct context when running.

#### Resolution

When working with multiple subscriptions the subscription context might be lost when invoking child runbooks. To ensure that the subscription context is passed to the child runbooks, add the `AzureRmContext` parameter to the cmdlet and pass the context to it.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Connect to Azure with RunAs account
$ServicePrincipalConnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name 'AzureRunAsConnection'

Add-AzureRmAccount `
    -ServicePrincipal `
    -TenantId $ServicePrincipalConnection.TenantId `
    -ApplicationId $ServicePrincipalConnection.ApplicationId `
    -CertificateThumbprint $ServicePrincipalConnection.CertificateThumbprint

$AzureContext = Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId $ServicePrincipalConnection.SubscriptionID

$params = @{"VMName"="MyVM";"RepeatCount"=2;"Restart"=$true}

Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook `
    –AutomationAccountName 'MyAutomationAccount' `
    –Name 'Test-ChildRunbook' `
    -ResourceGroupName 'LabRG' `
    -AzureRmContext $AzureContext `
    –Parameters $params –wait
```

### <a name="not-recognized-as-cmdlet"></a>Scenario: The runbook fails because of a missing cmdlet

#### Issue

Your runbook fails with an error similar to the following example:

```
The term 'Connect-AzureRmAccount' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.  Check the spelling of the name, or if the path was included verify that the path is correct and try again.
```

#### Cause

This error can be caused by the following reasons:

1. The module containing the cmdlet isn't imported into the automation account
2. The module containing the cmdlet is imported but is out of date

#### Resolution

This error can be resolved by completing one of the following tasks:

If the module is an Azure module, see [How to update Azure PowerShell modules in Azure Automation](../automation-update-azure-modules.md) to learn how to update your modules in your automation account.

If it's a separate module, make sure the module in imported in your Automation Account.

### <a name="job-attempted-3-times"></a>Scenario: The runbook job start was attempted three times, but it failed to start each time

#### Issue

Your runbook fails with the error:

```
The job was tried three times but it failed
```

#### Cause

This error can be caused by the following reasons:

1. Memory Limit. There are documented limits on how much memory is allocated to a Sandbox  [Automation service limits](../../azure-subscription-service-limits.md#automation-limits) so a job may fail it if it's using more than 400 MB of memory.

1. Network Sockets. Azure sandboxes are limited to 1000 concurrent network sockets as described at [Automation service limits](../../azure-subscription-service-limits.md#automation-limits).

1. Module Incompatible. This error can occur if module dependencies aren't correct and if they aren't, your runbook typically returns a "Command not found" or "Cannot bind parameter" message.

#### Resolution

Any of the following solutions fix the problem:

* Suggested methods to work within the memory limit are to split the workload between multiple runbooks, not process as much data in memory, not to write unnecessary output from your runbooks, or consider how many checkpoints you write into your PowerShell Workflow runbooks. You can use the clear method, such as `$myVar.clear()` to clear out the variable and use `[GC]::Collect()` to run garbage collection immediately, this will reduce the memory footprint of your runbook during runtime.

* Update your Azure modules by following the steps [How to update Azure PowerShell modules in Azure Automation](../automation-update-azure-modules.md).  

* Another solution is to run the runbook on a [Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md). Hybrid Workers aren't limited by the memory and network limits that Azure sandboxes are.

### <a name="fails-deserialized-object"></a>Scenario: Runbook fails because of deserialized object

#### Issue

Your runbook fails with the error:

```
Cannot bind parameter <ParameterName>.

Cannot convert the <ParameterType> value of type Deserialized <ParameterType> to type <ParameterType>.
```

#### Cause

If your runbook is a PowerShell Workflow, it stores complex objects in a deserialized format to persist your runbook state if the workflow is suspended.

#### Resolution

Any of the following three solutions fix this problem:

1. If you're piping complex objects from one cmdlet to another, wrap these cmdlets in an InlineScript.
2. Pass the name or value that you need from the complex object instead of passing the entire object.
3. Use a PowerShell runbook instead of a PowerShell Workflow runbook.

### <a name="quota-exceeded"></a>Scenario: Runbook job failed because the allocated quota exceeded

#### Issue

Your runbook job fails with the error:

```
The quota for the monthly total job run time has been reached for this subscription
```

#### Cause

This error occurs when the job execution exceeds the 500-minute free quota for your account. This quota applies to all types of job execution tasks such as testing a job, starting a job from the portal, executing a job by using webhooks and scheduling a job to execute by using either the Azure portal or in your datacenter. To learn more about pricing for Automation, see [Automation pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/automation/).

#### Resolution

If you want to use more than 500 minutes of processing per month, you need to change your subscription from the Free tier to the Basic tier. You can upgrade to the Basic tier by taking the following steps:  

1. Sign in to your Azure subscription  
2. Select the Automation account you wish to upgrade  
3. Click on **Settings** > **Pricing**.
4. Click **Enable** on page bottom to upgrade your account to the **Basic** tier.

### <a name="cmdlet-not-recognized"></a>Scenario: Cmdlet not recognized when executing a runbook

#### Issue

Your runbook job fails with the error:

```
<cmdlet name>: The term <cmdlet name> is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
```

#### Cause

This error is caused when the PowerShell engine can't find the cmdlet you're using in your runbook. This could be because the module containing the cmdlet is missing from the account, there's a name conflict with a runbook name, or the cmdlet also exists in another module and Automation can't resolve the name.

#### Resolution

Any of the following solutions fix the problem:  

* Check that you've entered the cmdlet name correctly.  
* Make sure the cmdlet exists in your Automation account and that there are no conflicts. To verify if the cmdlet is present, open a runbook in edit mode and search for the cmdlet you want to find in the library or run `Get-Command <CommandName>`. Once you've validated that the cmdlet is available to the account, and that there are no name conflicts with other cmdlets or runbooks, add it to the canvas and make sure that you're using a valid parameter set in your runbook.  
* If you do have a name conflict and the cmdlet is available in two different modules, you can resolve this by using the fully qualified name for the cmdlet. For example, you can use **ModuleName\CmdletName**.  
* If you're executing the runbook on-premises in a hybrid worker group, then make sure that the module and cmdlet is installed on the machine that hosts the hybrid worker.

### <a name="long-running-runbook"></a>Scenario: A long running runbook fails to complete

#### Issue

Your runbook shows in a **Stopped** state after running for 3 hours. You may also receive the error:

```
The job was evicted and subsequently reached a Stopped state. The job cannot continue running
```

This behavior is by design in Azure sandboxes because of the "Fair Share" monitoring of processes within Azure Automation, which automatically stops a runbook if it executes longer than three hours. The status of a runbook that goes past the fair-share time limit differs by runbook type. PowerShell and Python runbooks are set to a **Stopped** status. PowerShell Workflow runbooks are set to **Failed**.

#### Cause

The runbook ran over the 3 hour limit allowed by fair share in an Azure Sandbox.

#### Resolution

One recommended solution is to run the runbook on a [Hybrid Runbook Worker](../automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md).

Hybrid Workers aren't limited by the [fair share](../automation-runbook-execution.md#fair-share) 3 hour runbook limit that Azure sandboxes are. While Hybrid Runbook Workers aren't limited by the 3 hour fair share limit, runbooks ran on Hybrid Runbook Workers should still be developed to support restart behaviors in case of unexpected local infrastructure issues.

Another option is to optimize the runbook by creating [child runbooks](../automation-child-runbooks.md). If your runbook loops through the same function on a number of resources, such as a database operation on several databases, you can move that function to a child runbook. Each of these child runbooks executes in parallel in separate processes decreasing the total amount of time for the parent runbook to complete.

The PowerShell cmdlets that enable the child runbook scenario are:

[Start-AzureRMAutomationRunbook](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Automation/Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook) - This cmdlet allows you to start a runbook and pass parameters to the runbook

[Get-AzureRmAutomationJob](/powershell/module/azurerm.automation/get-azurermautomationjob) - This cmdlet allows you to check the job status for each child if there are operations that need to be performed after the child runbook completes.

## Common errors when importing modules

### <a name="module-fails-to-import"></a>Scenario: Module fails to import or cmdlets can't be executed after importing

#### Issue

A module fails to import or imports successfully, but no cmdlets are extracted.

#### Cause

Some common reasons that a module might not successfully import to Azure Automation are:

* The structure doesn't match the structure that Automation needs it to be in.
* The module is dependent on another module that hasn't been deployed to your Automation account.
* The module is missing its dependencies in the folder.
* The `New-AzureRmAutomationModule` cmdlet is being used to upload the module, and you have't given the full storage path or haven't loaded the module by using a publicly accessible URL.

#### Resolution

Any of the following solutions fix the problem:

* Make sure that the module follows the following format:
  ModuleName.Zip **->** ModuleName or Version Number **->** (ModuleName.psm1, ModuleName.psd1)
* Open the .psd1 file and see if the module has any dependencies. If it does, upload these modules to the Automation account.
* Make sure that any referenced .dlls are present in the module folder.
