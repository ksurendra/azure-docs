# Validate ADFS integration for Azure Stack

Use the Azure Stack Readiness Checker tool (AzsReadinessChecker) to validate that your environment is ready for ADFS integration with Azure Stack. You should validate ADFS integration before you begin data center integration or before an Azure Stack deployment.

The readiness checker validates:

* The *federation metadata* contains the valid XML elements for federation.
* The *ADFS SSL certificate* can be retrieved and chain of trust can be built. On stamp ADFS must trust the SSL certificates chain. The certificate must be signed by the same *certificate authority* as the Azure Stack deployment certificates or by a trusted root authority partner. For the full list of trusted root authority partners, see: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Trusted-Root-Certificate-123665ca
* *ADFS signing certificate* is trusted and not nearing expiry.

For more information about Azure Stack data center integration, see [Azure Stack datacenter integration - Identity](azure-stack-integrate-identity.md)

## Get the readiness checker tool

Download the latest version of the Azure Stack Readiness Checker tool (AzsReadinessChecker) from the [PSGallery](https://aka.ms/AzsReadinessChecker).  

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be in place.

**The computer where the tool runs:**

* Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016, with domain connectivity.
* PowerShell 5.1 or later. To check your version, run the following PowerShell cmd and then review the *Major* version and *Minor* versions:  
   > `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`
* The latest version of the [Microsoft Azure Stack Readiness Checker](https://aka.ms/AzsReadinessChecker) tool.

**Active Directory Federation Services environment:**

You need at least one of the following forms of metadata:

* The URL for ADFS federation metadata. For example, `https://adfs.contoso.com/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml`
* The federation metadata XML file. For example, FederationMetadata.xml

## Validate ADFS integration

1. On a computer that meets the prerequisites, open an administrative PowerShell prompt and then run the following command to install the AzsReadinessChecker.

     `Install-Module Microsoft.AzureStack.ReadinessChecker -Force`

1. From the PowerShell prompt, run the following to start validation. Specify the value for **-CustomADFSFederationMetadataEndpointUri** as the URI for the federation metadata:

     `Invoke-AzsADFSValidation -CustomADFSFederationMetadataEndpointUri https://adfs.contoso.com/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml`

1. After the tool runs, review the output. Confirm the status is OK for ADFS integration requirements. A successful validation appears similar to the following.

    ```
    Invoke-AzsADFSValidation v1.1809.1001.1 started.

    Testing ADFS Endpoint https://sts.contoso.com/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml

            Read Metadata:                         OK
            Test Metadata Elements:                OK
            Test SSL ADFS Certificate:             OK
            Test Certificate Chain:                OK
            Test Certificate Expiry:               OK

    Details:
    [-] In standalone mode, some tests should not be considered fully indicative of connectivity or readiness the Azure Stack Stamp requires prior to Data Center Integration.

    Log location (contains PII): C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\AzsReadinessChecker\AzsReadinessChecker.log
    Report location (contains PII): C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\AzsReadinessChecker\AzsReadinessCheckerReport.json

    Invoke-AzsADFSValidation Completed
    ```

In production environments, testing certificate chains of trust from an operators workstation cannot be considered fully indicative of the PKI trust posture in the Azure Stack infrastructure. The Azure Stack stamp’s Public VIP network needs the connectivity to the CRL for the PKI infrastructure.

## Report and log file

Each time validation runs, it logs results to **AzsReadinessChecker.log** and **AzsReadinessCheckerReport.json**. The location of these files displays with the validation results in PowerShell.

The validation files can help you share status before you deploy Azure Stack or investigate validation problems. Both files persist the results of each subsequent validation check. The report provides your deployment team confirmation of the identity configuration. The log file can help your deployment or support team investigate validation issues.

By default, both files are written to
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\AzsReadinessChecker\`.

Use:

* **-OutputPath** *path* parameter at the end of the run command line to specify a different report location.
* **-CleanReport** parameter at the end of the run command to clear *AzsReadinessCheckerReport.json* of previous report information. For more information, see [Azure Stack validation report](azure-stack-validation-report.md).

## Validation failures

If a validation check fails, details about the failure display in the PowerShell window. The tool also logs information to the *AzsReadinessChecker.log*.

The following examples provide guidance on common validation failures.

### Command Not Found

`Invoke-AzsADFSValidation : The term 'Invoke-AzsADFSValidation' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.`

**Cause** - PowerShell Autoload failed to load Readiness Checker module correctly.

**Resolution** – Import Readiness Checker module explicitly. Copy and paste the code below into PowerShell and update the \<version\> with the version number for the currently installed version.

`Import-Module "c:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Microsoft.AzureStack.ReadinessChecker\<version>\Microsoft.AzureStack.ReadinessChecker.psd1" -Force`
