# Entity roles in patterns are contextual subtypes
Roles are named, contextual subtypes of an entity used only in [patterns](luis-concept-patterns.md).

For example, in the utterance `buy a ticket from New York to London`, both New York and London are cities but each has a different meaning in the sentence. New York is the origin city and London is the destination city. 

Roles give a name to those differences:

|Entity|Role|Purpose|
|--|--|--|
|Location|origin|where the plane leaves from|
|Location|destination|where the plane lands|
|Prebuilt datetimeV2|to|end date|
|Prebuilt datetimeV2|from|beginning date|

## How are roles used in patterns?
In a pattern's template utterance, roles are used within the utterance: 

|Pattern with entity roles|
|--|
|`buy a ticket from {Location:origin} to {Location:destination}`|


## Role syntax in patterns
The entity and role are surrounded in parentheses, `{}`. The entity and the role are separated by a colon. 


[!include[H2 Roles versus hierarchical entities](../../../includes/cognitive-services-luis-hier-roles.md)] 

## Roles with prebuilt entities

Use roles with prebuilt entities to give meaning to different instances of the prebuilt entity within an utterance. 

### Roles with datetimeV2

The prebuilt entity, datetimeV2, does a great job of understanding a wide range of variety in dates and times in utterances. You may want to specify dates and date ranges differently than the prebuilt entity's default understanding.
